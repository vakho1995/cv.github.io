			<P class="text1">My name is Nhi. I'm looking for Frontend developer positions in both website and mobile environments, and I'll be using the technical and problem-solving skills I've developed via studies and work. I value user experience and work toward a faultless user interface, which allows me to manage multiple tasks at once and demonstrates my commitment, organization, and adaptability even under pressure. </P>
